                    Which Sandwich

A website for designing, sharing and rating sandwiches.
Users can list their favourite sandwiches using an expandable list of ingredients,
as well as submit suggestions for new ingredients to the admin for review.
A picture of their sandwich can optionally be uploaded.
Users can vote on other's sandwiches (thumbs or stars system).

Visitors will see a ranking of the best, worst and most controversial sandwiches.
Possible for visitors to vote anonymously when not logged in? Lower weighted vote, perhaps.
