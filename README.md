# Which Sandwich

## Setting up the virtual environment

1. Check that you have Python 3.x installed with `python --version`.
2. Create a virtual environment using `mkvirtualenv which_sandwich`.
3. Make sure that the virtual environment is activated (use `workon which_sandwich` if in doubt) and run `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

We're using Python 3.x and Django 2.0.2 for this project.
